      <description>Starting January 2019 I joined a Salsa class for the first time in my life. Coming from a caribbean country it is one of those things that I am expected to know. However, I never got around to learning. Situations where someone asked me to dance where always a source of anxiety for me.
Finally this year I decided to overcome my fears and learn. Dancing has become an incredible source of joy!</description>
