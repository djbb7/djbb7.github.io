      <description>Starting January 2019 I joined a Salsa class for the first time in my life. Coming from a caribbean country it is one of those things that I am expected to know, and I want to know. However, I never got around to learning.
Situations where people asked me to dance where always a source of anxiety for me. Finally this year I decided to overcome my fears and learn. Dancing has become an incredible source of joy!</description>

      <description>At the moment I am based in Helsinki but traveling quite often to Düsseldorf for work.
I am learning to dance salsa at Tanzhaus NRW with Janis and Zoe.
I am planning my holiday trip to Brazil in September 2019.
I am training for the Dolomyths Skyrace 23km that takes place in Canazei. I finally sign up, 5 years after I discovered the race online.</description>
