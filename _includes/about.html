    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="page">
    <p>I am <strong>Daniel Bruzual</strong>, <strong>computer engineer</strong>, <strong>entrepreneur</strong> and lover of the great outdoors. I was born in Venezuela but I have lived in several countries ever since I was young. I am currently based in <strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>.
    </p><p>
    I hold a dual degree in <strong>MSc Service Design and Engineering</strong> from Aalto University and University of Trento (GPA 4.91/5.00). My technical specialization focuses on <strong>mobile and cloud</strong> systems. My minor is on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I received my <strong>BSc Computer Engineering</strong> from Universidad Simón Bolívar in Venezuela (GPA 4.58/5.00).

    <strong>I have a passion for mobile applications</strong> and have made several Android apps: for fun (Voz Del Pueblo), for contests (Together App), and for things I needed which didn't exist (ProRemote). More recently I have been involved with <strong>Docker</strong> and the <strong>Internet of Things</strong>. I have been studying the internals of Docker components, and wrote my thesis on this subject (<em>Distributed Computing Framework for Heterogeneous IoT Devices</em>). I even presented this work at <strong>DockerCon Europe 2017</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am <strong>self-motivated</strong> and an <strong>autodidact</strong>. I taught myself how to make websites when I was 11 by getting up at 6:00 am on weekends and reading every guide I could find. When I was 16, I learnt how to <strong>program web applications</strong> in order to make a student survey system for my high school. They saved hundreds of hours of transcription every year, and were able to give teachers timely reports. <strong>I learn whatever skills</strong> I need to achieve my goals. For this reason, I do not like to limit myself to a set of technologies or tools.
    </p>

    I am currently working as a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> at Aalto University. I research about <strong>Fog computing on heterogeneous IoT devices</strong>. I am also a teaching assistant developing automated grading systems based on unit tests. Read more about what I am doing now <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}now.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Before initiating my studies, I worked as a freelance developer making custom <strong>Wordpress</strong> themes and plugins. I also worked for 1 year at <a href="http://www.mobmedianet.com">MobileMediaNetworks</a> in Venezuela, where I developed <strong>mobile applications and backends</strong> for Augmented Reality in magazines. I also did a 5-month internship at <a href="http://www.plista.com">Plista GmbH</a> in Berlin, where I was developed several <strong>recommendation algorithms</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am a polyglot, speaking <strong>Spanish</strong>, <strong>English</strong>, <strong>German</strong>, <strong>Italian</strong> and <strong>Portuguese</strong> fluently.

    On my spare time you will find me on a mountain, or making videos, or probably both. I like trailrunning and mountain-hiking. I also have a passion for kayak, having recently completed a 5-day trip around the Aeolian Islands in Sicily. For the past two years I have been learning to make videos, and one day I aspire to submit one to a mountain film festival.
